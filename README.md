This is a playground project for myself to learn [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/), a HTML5 creation engine.

I'm planning to learn to **game development basics** and how to make them work with browsers. The project uses **webpack** in order to organize and bundle.

PixiJS is a fun library to work with. This project uses v8.x. I'm willing to update this repository while I learn.

All the image assets are created by myself in this project. For sound, it's [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/).

Current projects are below:

- Hello World
- Tic-Tac-Toe

## Getting Started

After cloning the project:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Under `/src/index.js`, comment out the project you wish to see.

## Tech Stack

- PixiJS
- Webpack
- Javascript

## Project Summaries

### Hello World

It's the first step. There are just a "Hello world!" text and a ladybug which spins like crazy.

### Tic-Tac-Toe

The first classic game I create with PixiJS. I thought of a simple screen management and a UI system (just a simple button).
